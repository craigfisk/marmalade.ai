* How do I automatically find people I should connect with?
* Why can't I get random access into a worldwide pool?
* Can I have connections that are more purposeful and short-lived?
* How do the right people find me for the abilities I bring?
* And anonymously define my expertise?
* Isn't there a smart marketplace for this by now?
* Where I can own my information?
* And it is validated by the marketplace?
* Which makes connections I never would have found?
* Where everyone is valued for their contribution?
* And my group or business can be more effective?
