- How do I automatically find people I should connect with?
- Why can't I get random access into a worldwide pool?
  <!--   block  //-->
  <!-- Can I have connections that are more purposeful and short-lived? //-->
- How do the right people find me for work I'm great at doing?
  <!-- And anonymously define my expertise? //-->
  <!-- Isn't there a smart marketplace for this by now? //-->
  <!-- Where I can own my information? //-->
  <!-- And it is validated by the marketplace? //-->
- How can I make connections I never would have found?
  <!-- Where everyone is valued for their contribution? //-->
  <!-- And my group or business can be more effective? //-->
